Some Notes:

*A binary clock is a clock that displays the digits of a normal digital clock in binary.

[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]   <-2^3=8
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]   <-2^2=4
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]   <-2^1=2
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]   <-2^0=1
 H  H  m  m  s  s

ex. If the time is 15:49:33

[ ][ ][ ][x][ ][ ]   <-2^3=8
[ ][x][x][ ][ ][ ]   <-2^2=4
[ ][ ][ ][ ][x][x]   <-2^1=2
[x][x][ ][x][x][x]   <-2^0=1
 H  H  m  m  s  s

*A key matrix is used to bind significance to some segments of a message for
translation into a call to some functionality.

            10      None        _stop_stopper

Examples:

The message: 0000 is a call to Clock Functions function _clock_mode_on()

The message: 10011010 is a call to Timer Functions function _start_timer() with the parameter 1010.

*My environment: KaOS, PyCharm Community edition, Python3

*By "matrix" I mean an iterable inside another iterable, in this exercise a string inside a list.

*This is a guideline architecture, feel free to change anything, both making improvements and/or simplifications.

*You will need Qt5 for the GUI to work, undet linux sudo apt-get install Qt5 of sudo pacman -S Qt5 etc. , windows:
http://qt-project.org/downloads

*You will need PyQt5 for the GUI to work, under linux sudo apt-get install PyQt5 or sudo pacman -S PyQt5 etc. , windows:

*If it is too much hassle, you could just use a terminal version (create infinite loop and print out a matrix), though
 IMHO the GUI is worth the gratification. ;)

*My first time using Qt, something could be broken, though I implemented it and it worked as expected for me.

Have Fun!
